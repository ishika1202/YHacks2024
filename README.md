# Memora, a YHacks2024 submission

## Inspiration
### Dementia’s Cognitive and Health Impact
 🌎 Global burden: Dementia is a growing global health crisis, affecting approximately 55 million people worldwide. This number is expected to increase to 139 million by 2050 due to aging populations​ MDPI.

 🧠 Cognitive decline: The hallmark of dementia is the deterioration of memory, thinking, and communication skills. This leads to difficulties in daily functioning, such as forgetting personal details or failing to complete routine tasks​ Frontiers

## Link to loneliness and social isolation
🧍50% increased risk: Studies show that loneliness raises the risk of developing dementia by 50%. This occurs due to a lack of cognitive and social stimulation, which contributes to brain atrophy and cognitive decline​ MDPI

👂 Sensory loss connection: Hearing and visual impairments can lead to reduced social interaction, increasing loneliness and further accelerating cognitive deterioration​ MDPI

## Health Complications Related to Dementia and Loneliness
Up to 64% of lonely individuals experience a higher risk of depression, which can further exacerbate cognitive decline and increase dementia severity​ Frontiers
Loneliness is associated with a 29% increased risk of heart disease and a 32% increased risk of stroke. These cardiovascular complications are known contributors to vascular dementia and cognitive impairments​ Frontiers

## Prevention and Supportive Measures
🗣️ Social and cognitive engagement: Regular social interaction and mentally stimulating activities can reduce the risk of dementia by keeping the brain active. Engaging in conversations, group activities, and memory recall exercises can help maintain synaptic density and delay cognitive decline MDPI ​ Frontiers

⛹️‍♀️ Physical activity: Group exercise programs, such as Tai Chi or supervised aerobics, not only improve physical health but also stimulate blood flow to brain, thereby reducing harmful effects on cognition. Studies show that physical activity reduces the risk of cognitive decline by up to 30%​ SpringerLink

## What it does
🩵 Memora is first and foremost a companion.

It chats to you in the voices of your most close ones with memories that you share. Discussing memories improves the memory, reduces loneliness and lightens the mood.
Memora encourages you to stretch and move. It presents daily challenges and counts how many times you are able to complete the daily exercise challenge.
The holistic approach of combining mental and physical health addresses the root causes of dementia effectively and makes every day fun, full of important stories and memories ☀️☀️

## How we built it
Backend
Flask with Python for the application
OpenAI for the assistants that capture the memory and tone of the closes people around you, trained on past Whatsapp chat data
Resemble AI to make the responses sound very close to important people in user's life
Using OpenCV and Google's MediaPipe for exercise posture correction.
## Challenges we ran into
Integrations
When building the solution we came across many integration challenges, especially for connecting different AI elements. We were able to create a deep fake video of important people around you but unfortunately lacked credits to integrate it in to the app (future plans!!)
Making AI assistants match with the personas of our closed ones but ultimately we managed ## Accomplishments that we're proud of
## ❤️‍🩹 Vision
We as a team came together and built something we genuinely believed in. We all have grand parents who struggle with memory loss or loneliness and making their days better as well as happier makes a meaningful project :)
## What's next for Memora
👩‍💻 AI avatar of the closest people around you – completing the feature of using deep fake technology for the good

🌄 Integrating image and video-based content

🎯 Gamifying the recovery process

👭 Building a community for patients to foster a sense of belonging
